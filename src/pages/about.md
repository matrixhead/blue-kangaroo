My self Abhishek Ajith an Indian immigrant who currently lives in Canada and believes that my brain is capable of processing visual information 60,000 times faster than written information and have  fortunately completed bachelors in Mechanical Engineering. To add more thrill to my story, I currently work as a Cashier in a corner store and more excitingly completed two post graduation degrees in two different sectors , which doesn't even create a single shot of adrenaline rush in my brain.                                                              I am pursuing photography from my hobby to my career as I started to feel the need to 'create'. I am a man who is trying to escape from dunning- Kruger trap and tries to push my self  to be more objective, challenging and learning to let go. The world is bombarded with visual information therefore I always ask "why do things "rather than "how to do things".
